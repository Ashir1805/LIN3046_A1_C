       WILLIAM
		Can I help you?

	It is Anna Scott, the biggest movie star in the world -- here --
	in his shop.  The most divine, subtle, beautiful woman on earth.
	When she speaks she is very self-assured and self-contained.

				ANNA
		No, thanks.  I'll just look around.

				WILLIAM
		Fine.

	She wanders over to a shelf as he watches her -- and picks out a
	quite smart coffee table book.

				WILLIAM
		That book's really not good -- just
		in case, you know, browsing turned to
		buying.  You'd be wasting your money.

				ANNA
		Really?

				WILLIAM
		Yes.  This one though is... very 
		good.

	He picks up a book on the counter.

				WILLIAM
		I think the man who wrote it has 
		actually been to Turkey, which helps.
		There's also a very amusing incident
		with a kebab.
