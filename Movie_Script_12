INT. TAFFEY'S BAR MOMENTS LATER

        Deckard is at a telephone not far from  the bar.  He's
        got the phone hooked between his shoulder and ear while
        he notes a number.

                                DECKARD
                  .......six six five. Thanks.

        Deckard breaks the connection, then starts punching the
        numbers.

        Behind him the stage show is progressing.  A beautiful
        woman named SALOME is emerging from the large egg, very
        scantily clad, an erotic birth scene.

        Rachael appears on the telephone vid-screen.

                                RACHAEL
                  Hello.

                                DECKARD
                  People have walked out on me
                  before... but never when I was
                  being charming.

        Rachael freezes when she see who it is.  Says nothing.

                                DECKARD
                  Ya missed out on the drink I
                  poured ya.

        Rachael still says nothing.

                                DECKARD
                  Wanna try again ?

        For a long moment it seems Rachael isn't going to say
        anything.

        Rachael is bitter.

                                RACHAEL
                       (on Vid-screen)
                  Hunting... "skin jobs "?

                                DECKARD
                  Didn't find any.All I found was a bar.
                  Why waste it ?

                                RACHAEL
                       (on vid-screen)
                  Not my kind of place I'm afraid.

                                DECKARD
                  Meet me here.  We'll go someplace
                  else.  It's in the Fourth Sector....

        Something on the stage catches Deckard's eye. He frowns.

        On stage, a snake has emerged from the second egg.

        Deckard is suddenly pre-occupied with the stage show as
        he absently gives the address over the phone.

                                DECKARD
                  ...... the  Fourth Sector, on the line.
                  Taffey Lewis'  Snake Pit.

                                RACHAEL
                  I don't think so Mr. Deckard.
                  As I said......

        Deckard is staring at the stage show.

                                DECKARD
                         (absently)
                  See ya in a half hour.

        He hangs up.

        On stage, the snake and Salome are into sexy stuff.

                                                   CUT TO


        INT. BACKSTAGE A LITTLE LATER

        You can hear applause and catcalls from the audience
        as Salome flounces backstage.  She starts toward the
        dressing room.

        Deckard emerges from the shadow.

                                DECKARD
                  Excuse me, Miss  Salome....

        She turns.  Deckard's posture and attitude suggest humble,
        sleazy persistence.  He comes closer with his shit-eating
        grin.

                                DECKARD
                  I'd like to have a word with you
                  if I could.

        Salome stands almost six feet tall in her high heels and
        looks down on him with haughty suspicion... a girl who
        knows how to handle cheap hits.

                                SALOME
                  Yeah ?

                                DECKARD
                  I'm with the  American Federation of
                  Variety Artists....

        He holds up a hand as if to stop her from protesting.

                                DECKARD
                  Don't worry, I'm not here to
                  make you join... that's not my department.

        He glances around like a guy who's not supposed to be
        there.

                                DECKARD
                  I'm an investigator for the Confidential
                  Committee on Moral  Abuses.

        She nods, taking it a little more seriously.

                                DECKARD
                  There's been reports of the
                  management taking liberties with
                  the artists in this place.

                                SALOME
                  I don't know nothing about it.

                                DECKARD
                  You haven't felt yourself to be
                  exploited by the management in
                  any way?

        She's definitely puzzled.

                                SALOME
                  How do you mean 'exploited'?

                                DECKARD
                  Like to get this job... did you
                  or were you asked to do anything
                  lewd or unsavory or otherwise
                  repulsive to your person?

                                SALOME
                  Are you for real?

                                DECKARD
                  Oh, yeah.  You'd be surprised
                  what goes on around here.  I'd
                  like to check the dressing room
                  if I could.

                                SALOME
                  What the fuck for?

                                DECKARD
                  For holes.

        This guy might be an asshole, but he's funny.

                                SALOME
                  I don't believe this.

        She shrugs and they go in.
