## Script
                              WILLIAM
		Can I help you?

	It is Anna Scott, the biggest movie star in the world -- here --
	in his shop.  The most divine, subtle, beautiful woman on earth.
	When she speaks she is very self-assured and self-contained.

				ANNA
		No, thanks.  I'll just look around.

				WILLIAM
		Fine.

	She wanders over to a shelf as he watches her -- and picks out a
	quite smart coffee table book.

				WILLIAM
		That book's really not good -- just
		in case, you know, browsing turned to
		buying.  You'd be wasting your money.

				ANNA
		Really?

				WILLIAM
		Yes.  This one though is... very 
		good.

	He picks up a book on the counter.

				WILLIAM
		I think the man who wrote it has 
		actually been to Turkey, which helps.
		There's also a very amusing incident
		with a kebab.

ANNA
		Thanks.  I'll think about it.

	William suddenly spies something odd on the small TV monitor
	beside him.

				WILLIAM
		If you could just give me a second.

	Her eyes follow him as he moves toward the back of the shop and 
	approaches a man in slightly ill-fitting clothes.

				WILLIAM
		Excuse me.

				THIEF
		Yes.

				WILLIAM
		Bad news.

				THIEF
		What?

				WILLIAM
		We've got a security camera in this
		bit of the shop.

				THIEF
		So?

				WILLIAM
		So, I saw you put that book down your
		trousers.

				THIEF
		What book?

				WILLIAM
		The one down your trousers.

				THIEF
		I haven't got a book down my trousers.

				WILLIAM
		Right -- well, then we have something 
		of an impasse.  I tell you what -- 
		I'll call the police -- and,	what can 
		I say? -- If I'm wrong about the whole 
		book-down-the-trousers scenario, I 
		really apologize.

				THIEF
		Okay -- what if I did have a book down
		my trousers?

				WILLIAM
		Well, ideally, when I went back to
		the desk, you'd remove the Cadogan 
		guide to Bali from your trousers, and
		either wipe it and put it back, or 
		buy it.  See you in a sec.

	He returns to his desk.  In the monitor we just glimpse, as does 
	William, the book coming out of the trousers and put back on the
	shelves.  The thief drifts out towards the door.  Anna, who has 
	observed all this, is looking at a blue book on the counter.

				WILLIAM
		Sorry about that...

				ANNA
		No, that's fine.  I was going to 
		steal one myself but now I've changed
		my mind.  Signed by the author, I see.

				WILLIAM
		Yes, we couldn't stop him.  If you 
		can find an unsigned copy, it's 
		worth an absolute fortune.

	She smiles.  Suddenly the thief is there.

				THIEF
		Excuse me.

				ANNA
		Yes.

				THIEF
		Can I have your autograph?

				ANNA
		What's your name?

				THIEF
		Rufus.

	She signs his scruffy piece of paper.  He tries to read it.

				THIEF
		What does it say?

				ANNA
		Well, that's the signature -- and
		above, it says 'Dear Rufus -- you
		belong in jail.'

				THIEF
		Nice one.  Would you like my phone
		number?

ANNA
		Tempting but... no, thank you.

	Thief leaves.

				ANNA
		I think I will try this one.

	She hands William a ?20 note and the book he said was rubbish.
	He talks as he handles the transaction.

				WILLIAM
		Oh -- right -- on second thoughts 
		maybe it wasn't that bad.  Actually
		-- it's a sort of masterpiece really.
		None of those childish kebab 
		stories you get in so many travel
		books these days.  And I'll throw in
		one of these for free.

	He drops in one of the signed books.

				WILLIAM
		Very useful for lighting fires, 
		wrapping fish, that sort of things.

	She looks at him with a slight smile.

				ANNA
		Thanks.

	And leaves.  She's out of his life forever.  William is a little 
	dazed.  Seconds later Martin comes back in.

				MARTIN
		Cappuccino as ordered.

				WILLIAM
		Thanks.  I don't think you'll believe
		who was just in here.

				MARTIN
		Who?  Someone famous?

	But William's innate natural English discretion takes over.

				WILLIAM
		No. No-one -- no-one.

	They set about drinking their coffees.

				MARTIN
		Would be exciting if someone famous
		did come into the shop though, 
		wouldn't it?  Do you know -- this is
		pretty incredible actually -- I once
		saw Ringo Starr.  Or at least I think
		it was Ringo.  It might have been 
		that broke from 'Fiddler On The Roof,'
		Toppy.

				WILLIAM
		Topol.

				MARTIN
		That's right -- Topol.

				WILLIAM
		But Ringo Starr doesn't look 
		anything like Topol.

				MARTIN
		No, well... he was quite a long way
		away.

				WILLIAM
		So it could have been neither of them?

				MARTIN
		I suppose so.

				WILLIAM
		Right.  It's not a classic anecdotes,
		is it?

				MARTIN
		Not classic, no.

	Martin shakes his head.  William drains his cappuccino.
