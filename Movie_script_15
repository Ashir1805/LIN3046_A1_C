## Script:

REESE

Good evening. Agents Reese and Foley from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

(Reese displays his ID)

Mind stepping over here?

Marty cautiously steps over.

MARTY

What's this all about?

FOLEY

Routine radiation check.

Foley takes a Geiger Counter and checks Marty. Nothing unusual happens until Foley checks Marty’s feet. Then there is some noticeable clicking, especially on the foot that went nearest the Plutonium. Reese and Foley exchange a look.

REESE

Have you got any identification?

Marty hesitantly hands Reese his wallet.

MARTY

What, am I radioactive or something?

FOLEY

No, no, not beyond an acceptable level.

REESE

Have you been X-rayed recently, Martin?

FOLEY

Perhaps been in contact with some luminous paint?

MARTY

No....

REESE

Been any place unusual in the past 12 hours?

MARTY

Home, school, here.

FOLEY

Been in the vicinity of 2980 Monroe Avenue today?

MARTY

Where?

REESE

Over by the old Orpheum Theater.

Marty hesitates a moment.

MARTY

No.

Reese hands Marty back his wallet.

REESE

Okay, Martin. You have a good evening now.

MARTY

Yeah. Right.

Reese and Foley get back in their car and drive off. Marty thinks a moment, then runs like hell the other way down the street!

EXT. ORPHEUM THEATER – NIGHT

Marty runs through the street to the Orpheum Theater. The only thing on the street besides him is newspaper blowing along the gutters. Marty tries the door to the upstairs. It’s locked. Marty steps back and looks at the upper floor.

Suddenly, 3 upper floor windows are blown out by a tremendous gush of air!

MARTY

Jesus!

He tries the door again. Marty has no other choice: he BREAKS THE GLASS in the door and lets himself in!

Marty races up the stairs to the laboratory. The door with the locks on it is unlocked, and LIGHT can be seen coming from the crack under the door.

Marty rushes through the door into

INT. THE “LOCKED” ROOM

Professor Brown is standing next to a HOMEMADE NUCLEAR REACTOR, made from an old furnace, a hot water heater, and boiler room parts. He has one hand on a rope, and is adjusting some dials and gauges.

SHEMP is sitting quietly on a stool directly under the focusing lens of the Professor’s invention. He’s wearing his organ grinder clothes, with a digital watch around his neck.

MARTY

Professor!

The Professor, although surprised to see Marty, is in command of the situation.

PROF. BROWN

Get behind that lead shield!

He points to the shield at one side of the room.

MARTY

But Professor----

PROF. BROWN

Get behind the shield! I'm about to release radiation!

Marty hurries behind the shield.

Professor Brown pulls the rope ever so slightly.

The Power Converter is activated! The low frequency hum of vacuum tubes becomes more intense---the frequency begins to rise, accompanied by the crackle of static electricity!

Shemp looks around, curious about all of these sounds...the sounds grow in intensity...tension builds...and at exactly 9:00, Professor Brown releases the rope. At that moment, a high frequency tone is emitted, accompanied by a FOCUSED BEAM OF BLINDING RED LIGHT---like a spotlight---which hits Shemp!

Shemp DISAPPEARS! And the top half of the stool disappears with him, leaving the lower halves of the legs (which were not hit by the beam) to topple to the floor!

Air rushes through the lab to fill the vacuum that was created by Shemp’s disappearance!

The sound of the equipment dies down, and a stunned Marty McFly steps out from behind the shield.

MARTY

Jesus!! Professor, you just disintegrated Shemp!

Professor Brown shook his head, a smile playing around his lips.

PROF. BROWN

No, Marty. Shemp's molecular structure is completely intact.

MARTY

Then where is he?

PROF. BROWN

The appropriate question to ask is when is he. You see, Shemp has just become the world's first time traveller. I've sent Shemp into the future---two minutes into future, to be exact.

MARTY

The future? What are you talking about? Where's Shemp??

PROF. BROWN

Shemp is right here in this room...two minutes from now. And at exactly 9:02, we'll catch up to him.

MARTY

Now hold on a minute, Professor. Hold the phone. Are you trying to tell me that this---all of this here---that this is---it's a---a---

PROF. BROWN

A time machine.

Marty has to sit down to take this one in.

PROF. BROWN

I always knew it would work. I knew it would work when I built it 33 years ago. But I was never able to harness enough power to test it. Power is the key. Massive amounts of energy to accelerate matter to the speed of light while creating an intense gravitational field. But generating that kind of energy has never been possible...until this afternoon.

MARTY

Because of that Coke.

PROF. BROWN

Precisely.

Brown takes on the characteristics of a tour guide as he explains the machine.
