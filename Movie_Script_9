## Script:
                 The convicts sing in time with the rhythmic pulls on the
rope -

                      CONVICTS
          Ha - Ha -

                    CONVICT 3                                   
          Ha - Ha -
          Look down, look down
          Don't look them in the eye                            

                    CONVICTS                                    
          Look down, look down
          You're here until you die.

                    CONVICT 4                                   
          No God above
          And Hell alone below

                    CONVICTS                                    
          Look down, look down
          There's twenty years to go.

The camera RISES UP to find JAVERT, the officer in charge       
of the convict workforce, looking on, his face rain-lashed      
and expressionless. He stands above the men on the top of
the dock, as lines of convicts labour beneath him on the
steep steps of the dock wall.

Behind Javert, through the storm rain we glimpse a forest of   
half-built ships, their ribbed frames like great skeletons in   
the mist.                                                       

FOREGROUND convicts are at work on another ship that is
almost completed, labouring in the crashing spray.

                    CONVICT 2                                   
          I've done no wrong
          Sweet Jesus, hear my prayer!

                    CONVICTS
          Look down, look down
          Sweet Jesus doesn't care.

                    CONVICT 5                                   
          I know she'll wait
          I know that she'll be true -

                    CONVICTS
          Look down, look down
          They've all forgotten you.                            

                    CONVICT 1                                   
          When I get free
          You won't see me
          Here for dust!
                                                         3.


                    CONVICTS
          Look down, look down
          Don't look'em in the eye.

                    CONVICT 3                                     
          How long, O Lord
          Before you let me die?

                    CONVICTS                                      
          Look down, look down
          You'll always be a slave.
          Look down, look down
          You're standing in your grave.

With a last great heave the lines of convicts haul the            
damaged ship onto the slipway.                                    

CRACK! The stern flagpole of the ship snaps in a vicious gust     
of wind and crashes down into the shallow water near Valjean.     
Javert sees and points his stick at Valjean in silent             
command. Valjean stares back for a beat, defying him. Then he     
drops down into the seething water and re-emerges with the        
great mast in his hands, held over his head. His head breaks      
water with his bitter gaze still on Javert, as he throws the      
mast ashore in a deliberate display of strength.                  

Javert nods to the guards, and they begin to form the
chained men into lines to return to their prison. The storm
is passing now, blown by the driving wind.

Javert approaches Jean Valjean.                                   

                    JAVERT
          Now Prisoner 24601.                                     
          Your time is up
          And your parole's begun.
          You know what that means?                               

                    VALJEAN
          Yes. It means I'm free.

                    JAVERT
          No! It means you get                                    
          Your yellow ticket-of-leave.

He hands Valjean a folded yellow paper.                           

                    JAVERT
          This badge of shame
          You'll show it everywhere.
          It warns you're a dangerous man.                        

                    VALJEAN
          I stole a loaf of bread
          My sister's child was close to
          death
          And we were starving.
                                                          4.


                        JAVERT
              You will starve again
              Unless you learn the meaning of
              the law.

                        VALJEAN
              I know the meaning of those
              nineteen years
              A slave of the law!

                        JAVERT
              Five years for what you did,
              The rest because you tried to
              run.
              Yes, 24601!

                        VALJEAN
              My name is Jean Valjean!

                        JAVERT
              And I'm Javert!
              Do not forget my name.
              Do not forget me -
              24601!

    He strides away to command the lines of convicts as they're
    marched away. Valjean walks away, hardly able to take in            
    that he is free at last.

    The convicts sing as he goes.                                       

                        CONVICTS
              Look down, look down
              You'll always be a slave.
              Look down, look down
              You're standing in your grave.
