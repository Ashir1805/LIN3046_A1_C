JOHN
                         Hello.

               His hand adjusts a microphone on his lapel.

                                     JOHN
                         Hello, hello. Hello...

               He shifts in his chair. Coughs. He looks straight at us.

                                     JOHN
                         I don't believe in perfect love. You 
                         know, love that comes out of the sky 
                         like a thunderbolt and uh... This is 
                         ridiculous.

               He removes the microphone. He sits there, thinking very hard.

                                     JOHN
                         No. No no no. Nope.

               He stands, turns and stretches.

                                                                  BLACKOUT:

               FADE UP:

               He is sitting as before, looking at us.

                                     JOHN
                         Running. Reading. Going out. Staying 
                         in. The countryside. Films, if they're 
                         good.

                                                                  BLACKOUT:

               FADE UP:

                                     JOHN
                         Thoughtful. Outgoing. Ambitious. 
                         Well-read. Reasonably popular. 
                         Balanced. Trusting. Quite attractive. 
                         Outgoing.

                                                                  BLACKOUT:

               FADE UP:

                                     JOHN
                         Someone intelligent, of course. Kind. 
                         Pretty I suppose. But its not 
                         critical.
