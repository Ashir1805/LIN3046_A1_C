FADE IN:

A WOMAN’S HANDS
Folding a PAPER NAPKIN. Nails clipped short, no polish.

                       SALT’S VOICE
           Fold the napkin into quarters...
           Fold the top in half diagonally.

INT. SALT'S OFFICE - DIVERSIFIED PETROLEUM - DAY

As EVELYN SALT checks her computer screen. 

She’s on a DINNER NAPKIN FOLDING website. 

Out her window: WASHINGTON DC.

                       SALT
           (reading off screen)
           Fold the right side back, one third of the way down.

As she does this, a NEW ANGLE and she’s unaware that TED WINTER stops outside her door,
watches as she finishes the last few folds, then slides a plastic fork, spoon and knife 
down inside the paper napkin ‘pouch’. Very neat.

                       WINTER
           Are you doing this on company time?

                       SALT
           Got a big dinner tonight. I want the
           table just... perfect.

                       WINTER
           If the taxpayers only knew.

He steps in to take a closer look. Winter is 45, every inch the tough, 
but fair executive type. He has a briefcase-bag over his shoulder. On his way out.

                       SALT
           I could’ve done a crown fold, a lily
           goblet. Hmmm. What do you think?

                       WINTER
           I don’t really have an opinion.

She pokes at it, frowns, dissatisfied.

                       SALT 
           It’s not very sexy.

Winter looks to a desk PHOTO of Salt and her man MIKE DUNCAN. 
He tries to comes up with something reassuring to say.

                       WINTER
            It’s utilitarian. Utilitarian is the
           new sexy.

She looks over her shoulder at him: Huh? He shrugs.

                       WINTER
           Walk me out.

INT. HALLWAY - DIVERSIFIED PETROLEUM - DAY Salt and Winter walk.

                      SALT
           You leaving for the funeral?

                       WINTER
           4:55 out of Dulles. New York’s going
           to be a zoo.

                       SALT
           He was a pretty great guy, huh?

                       WINTER
           The last gentleman. Public servant
           for forty-two years. Died in his sleep leaving a better, 
           safer world than he found. I’d take that epitaph.

                       SALT
           I wished I had known him.
           He nods, wish she had as well.

                       WINTER
           The Maelev summit starts tomorrow. I
           need all those reports waiting at Camp David in the AM. Maelev arrives at one.

                       SALT
           Did you know he made his money as a
           student selling Pink Floyd and Led Zeppelin bootlegs?

                       WINTER
           I’m more interested in his position
           on the Ukraine, the possibility of using force to redraw the map of 
           Eastern Europe, that kind of thing.

CUT TO:

                       SALT
           I don’t know how you push all this
           paper, Ted. I’d go crazy if I did it full time.
           Laughing, Winter fishes out his ID as they near... A SECURITY CHECKPOINT

                       WINTER
           Don’t worry, you’ll be back in the
           field in a week. Thanks for the paper pushing help by the way.

Winter hands his briefcase-bag to the SECURITY GUARD at the METAL DETECTORS. 
Then he swipes his ID. You need to clear security to leave as well as enter.

                       WINTER (CONT’D)
           Have a great dinner, Ev. Happy
           anniversary.

                       SALT
           Thank you. Have a good funeral.
           (a beat)
           That didn’t come out right.

TODD BOTTOMS, a young Yale graduate hurries over from the direction they just came. Flagging Winters down.
                       BOTTOMS
           Sir! Sir!
           (Winter looks back)
           We got a walk-in! A defector. Ten minutes ago.

Salt gestures to the Diversified Petroleum LOGO on the wall.

                       SALT
           I guess he’s not buying our cover.

                       WINTER
           Did you get his bona fides?

                       BOTTOMS
           Won’t give ‘em. But he’s Russian.
           He’s very strange. And...

He looks from Winter to Salt, back to Winter

                       BOTTOMS (CONT’D)
           He wants to talk to Salt. He asked
           for her by name.

Salt and Winter exchange a look. How odd. Winter looks at his watch.

                       WINTER
           I got twenty minutes.
