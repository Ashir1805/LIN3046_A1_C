                      SHANE
                    Lieutenant Shane Wolfe, United States
                    Navy. I'm gonna get you outta here. But
                    you have to do exactly what I say, when I
                    say it. My way -- no highway option. Do
                    you copy?
                           (Plummer nods, terrified.)
                    Where's the briefcase?
          
          The Professor gestures across the room, where a metal
          BRIEFCASE is floating. Shane calmly HANDCUFFS it to his
          own waist. As the water rises, to the roof.
          
                                 PLUMMER
                    How did you know where I...
          
          Shane sticks the mouth piece into Plummer's mouth, giving
          him his oxygen.
          
          EXT. ON THE DECK - SIMULTANEOUS
          
                                                                    4.
          
          
          
          The Armed Guards stop shooting into the water. One of
          our SEALS calls out to them, in PERFECT SERBIAN:
          
                                 SEAL
                    KEEP SHOOTING!
          
          The Guards fire again. The SEAL speaks into his neck mic.
          
                                 SEAL (CONT'D)
                    Give it a second, they're almost out of
                    ammo.
          
          The Seal calls out: "shoot more, more!" They do, until
          there's nothing but empty CLICKS from their guns.
          
                                 SEAL (CONT'D)
                    Now Lieutenant. Chopper's four meters at
                    your 10 o'clock.
          
          INT. SHIP'S HOLD - CONTINUOUS
          
          Just before the water envelopes him and Plummer...
          
                                 SHANE
                           (into his mic)
                    I've got the Prof and the case. First
                    round's on me back at Virginia Beach.
          
          Shane takes a deep breath, and pulls himself, the
          Professor and the briefcase UNDER the water.
          
          EXT. OCEAN'S SURFACE - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Shane and the Professor rise to the surface as the boat
          falters behind them. Shane pulls out a retractable
          CROSSBOW. It clicks open and he shoots a CABLE into the
          belly of the helicopter above him.
          
                                 SHANE
                    Hold on.
          
          INT. HELICOPTER - A SECOND LATER
          
          Shane appears at the Pilot's door, holding the Professor.
          Shane addresses the Pilot in perfect SERBIAN.
          
                                 SHANE
                    You know how to swim?
          
          The Pilot nods, terrified. Shane TOSSES the Pilot out.
          
          Shane swings into the hot seat and grabs the controls,
          pulling the Professor in behind him.
          
                                                              5.
          
          
          
          ON THE SURFACE OF THE WATER - CONTINUOUS
          
          The SEALS on the Jet Skis SALUTE Shane in the chopper,
          then disappear gracefully back into the water.
          
          INT. HELICOPTER - CONTINUOUS
          
          Shane smiles, clearly he loves this kind of day. He looks
          beside him, the Professor looks terrified. The Professor
          takes out his mouth piece.
          
                                 PLUMMER
                    Oh my God. I can't believe you... how'd
                    we... That was the most incredible...
          
          Shane sticks the mouth piece back in the Professors'
          mouth, shutting him up.
          
                                 SHANE
                    Better keep that on `til we get to the
                    rendezvous point.
          
                                 PLUMMER
                           (through the mouth piece)
                    Why? Poison gas?
          
                                 SHANE
                           (re: the oxygen)
                    No. I'm just not big on chit chat.
