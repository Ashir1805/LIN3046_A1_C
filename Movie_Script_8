INT DOCTOR'S OFFICE - DAY
          The real Hazel is no less beautiful than the one we just saw.

           HAZEL (V.O.)
           Late in the Winter of my 17th
           year...

          There are, however, some key and obvious differences.
          First, you'll notice the OXYGEN TUBE in her nostrils which
          help her to breathe.

          Second, you'll notice her hair - which we couldn't see in the
          grass. It's much shorter than the "Perfect" version, the
          result of someone whose head was completely shaved a few
          years before.

           HAZEL (V.O.)
           ... my mother decided I was
           depressed.

                          HAZEL
           I'm not depressed.

          Hazel's legs dangle over the side of an exam table. Her
          mother FRANNIE (early 40s, younger than she feels) explains
          to the DOCTOR:

                          FRANNIE
           ... she eats like a bird. She
           barely leaves the house,

                          HAZEL
           I'm not depressed.

                          FRANNIE
           ... she reads the same book over
           and over...

                          DOCTOR
           She's depressed.

                          HAZEL
           I'm not depressed!

          Off her look, CUT TO:
          QUICK SEQUENCE, which play over:

                          HAZEL (V.O.)
           The booklets and web sites always
           list depression as a side effect of
           cancer...

          - A SHOPPING MALL. Filled with TEENAGE GIRLS - gossipping,
          laughing - being teenage girls, basically. And here's Hazel.
          With her Mom. And her oxygen tank. Just another day.

           3.

                         

                          HAZEL (V.O.)
           Depression's not a side effect of
           cancer...

          - HAZEL'S LIVING ROOM. She sits watching game shows in the
          middle of the afternoon. Her Mom brings her a sandwich. A
          glass of water. And then a whole host of prescription meds.
          Hazel eyes them with indifference.

                          HAZEL (V.O.)
           ... it's a side effect of dying.

          - A STARBUCKS. Hazel sits alone reading a dog-eared, heavily
          underlined copy of a novel ("An Imperial Affliction" by Peter
          Van Houten). She only looks up when distracted by a squeal of
          delight. A YOUNG GUY has lifted a YOUNG GIRL over his
          shoulder playfully. He spins her around. Hazel watches a beat
          - goes back to the book.

                          HAZEL (V.O.)
           Which is what was happening to me.
