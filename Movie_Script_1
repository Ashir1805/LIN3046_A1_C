## Script:

                       MAE
                 (to the MAN)
           Are you somebody?

                       MAN
           No, honey, I'm just a working stiff.

    The MAN keep walking and MAE returns to her cohorts
    just as PUPKIN arrives.

                         MAE
           Hi, Rupert.

                       CELESTE
                 (coolly)
           Hello, Rupert.

                       SIDNEY
           Who did you get?

                 PUPKIN
           (distractedly)
     Nobody.

PUPKIN carefully places himself near the door, a step or
two away from the other professionals.

                 MAE
           (to SIDNEY)
     I got Mr. Raf Vallone outside 21.

                 CELESTE
           (to SIDNEY about PUPKIN)
     He'd never tell you anyway, Sidney.

                 MAE
     Then I got him again at the
     Pierre at four o'clock.

                 SIDNEY
     Be a dear, Mae. I don't happen
     to have Mr. Vallone.

                 MAE
     You know what I want for him.

                 SIDNEY
     But I have only six Barbra's left.
     You know how difficult she is to
     work with.

                 MAE
     I don't have her even once.

                 CELESTE
           (to MAE)
     Maybe Rupert would help you.

PUPKIN shoots a hostile glance back at CELESTE.

                 SIDNEY
     Would you do that, Rupert? You don't
     feel about Barbra the way I do.

                 MAE
     I'll give you Mr. Burt Reynolds too.

                 CELESTE
           (needling RUPERT)
     Look, Sidney, Rupert doesn't do
     that sort of thing.

                 SIDNEY
     How about it, Rupert?   I'll give
     you whoever you want.

SIDNEY starts pulling little white cards out of his paper
bag and reading them off.

                    SIDNEY
     Rodney    Dangerfield ... Richard
     Harris    ... Liza Minelli ... and
     she's    not so easy to work with
     either    ... Louise Lasser!

                 CELESTE
     You're wasting your time.

PUPKIN has been trying to remain apart from the other
three. Finally he turns to SIDNEY.

                 PUPKIN
     Look, Sidney. I'm just not
     interested. This isn't my
     whole life, you know.

                 CELESTE
     What's that supposed to mean --
     that it's my whole life, or
     Sidney's or Mae's?

                 MAE
     It is so my whole life.

                 CELESTE
     Shut up, Mae. What about your
     mother? Isn't she part of
     your life?

                 MAE
     It's her whole life too.

The show breaks. The doors swing open and people pour out.
The crowd around the backstage door swells.

                 POLICEMAN
           (to the crowd)
     If you want Jerry's autograph, give
     me your piece of paper and I'll
     send it backstage.

A number of people in the crowd hand in pieces of paper.
PUPKIN is standing next to a young couple, about college
age. The YOUNG GIRL has just sent in her paper.
