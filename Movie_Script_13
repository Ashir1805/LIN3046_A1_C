1 INT. NETHERFIELD - HERTFORDSHIRE - DAY. I

          A vast mansion is coming to life. Maids pull dustsheets
          off furniture; servants open shutters. Sunshine spills
          into the great rooms of Netherfield. outside, a glimpse
          of rolling parkland.

          "It is a truth universally
          acknowledged...

          Its a whirlwind of activity. Servants bustle around,
          sweeping and polishing, readying the house for its new
          occupants. The shutters of a room are opened onto the
          imposing gardens. A coach pulls up and, through the
          window, we see a young man get out.

          "that a single man in possession of a
          good fortune, must be in want of a wife"

          A white sheet is pulled from a spinet and obscures our
          vision.

2 EXT. LONGBOURN HOUSE - DAY. 2

          Elizabeth Bennet, 20, good humoured, attractive, clearly
          nobody's fool, walks through a field of tall meadow
          grass. She is reading a novel entitled 'First
          Impressions'. She approaches Longbourn, a fairly run down
          17th Century house with a small moat around it. Elizabeth
          jumps up onto a wall and crosses the moat by walking a
          wooden plank duck board, a reckless trick learnt in early
          childhood. She walks passed the back of the house where,
          through an open window to the library, we see her mother
          and father, Mr and Mrs Bennet.

                         MRS BENNET
          My dear Mr Bennet, have you heard that
          Netherfield Park is let at last?
          We follow Elizabeth into the house, but still overhear
          her parents' conversation.

          MRS BENNET (CONT'D)
          Do you not want to know who has taken it?

                         MR BENNET
          As you wish to tell me, I doubt I have
          any choice in the matter...
                    
  3 INT. LONGBOURN - CONTINUOUS.

          As Elizabeth walks through the hallway, we hear the sound
          of piano scales plodding through the afternoon. She walks
          down the entrance hall past the room where Mary, 18, the
          bluestocking of the family, is practising, and finds
          Kitty, 16, the second youngest, and Lydia, 15, the
          precocious baby of the family, are listening at the door
          to the library.

                         LYDIA

                         (TO ELIZABETH)
          Have you heard? A Mr Bingley, a young man
          from the North of England, has come down
          on Monday in a chaise and four.

                         KITTY
          With five thousand a year!
          Jane, (the eldest, most beautiful and most charmingly
          naive of the girls), joins them at the door.

                         JANE
          Goodness!

                         LYDIA
          - and he's single to be sure!

          INT. LIBRARY - LONGBOURN - CONTINUOUS.

          Mr Bennet is trying to ignore Mrs Bennet.

                         MRS BENNET
          What a fine thing for our girls!

                         MR BENNET
          Bow can it affect them?

                         MRS BENNET
          My dear Mr Bennet, how can you be so
          tiresome! You know that he must marry one
          of them.

                         MR BENNET
          Oh, so that is his design in settling
          here?
          Mr Bennet takes a book from his table and walks out of
          the library into the corridor where the girls are
          gathered, Mrs Bennet following.

  4 INT. CORRIDOR - LONGBOURN - THE SAME.

          Mr Bennet walks through the girls to the drawing room
          pursued by Mrs Bennet.

                         MRS BENNET
          - So you must go and visit him at once.

          5 INT. DRAWING ROOM - LONGBOURN - THE SAME. 5

          Mr Bennet walks to the bookshelf to replace the book he
          is carrying. Mary is there practising the piano. The
          girls come in to listen.

                         LYDIA
          Oh, yes, Papa.

                         KITTY
          Please, Papa!

                         MR BENNET
          There is no need, for I already have.
          The piano stops. A frozen silence. They all stare.

                         MRS BENNET
          You have?

                         JANE
          when?

                         MRS BENNET
          • How can you tease me, Mr Bennet. You have
          no compassion for my poor nerves?

                         MR BENNET
          You mistake me, my dear. I have a high
          respect for them; they are my constant
          companions these twenty years.

                         MRS BENNET
          Is he amiable?

                         KITTY
          Is he handsome?

                         LYDIA
          He's sure to be handsome.

                         ELIZABETH

                         (IRONICALLY)
          With five thousand a year, it would not
          matter if he had a big pink face.

                         MR BENNET
          I will give my hearty consent to his
          marrying whichever of the girls he
          chooses.

                         LYDIA
          So will he come to the ball tomorrow?

                         MR BENNET
          I believe so.
          Lydia and Kitty shriek with excitement.

                         KITTY

                         (TO JANE)
          I have to have your spotted muslin,
          please!

                         LYDIA
          I need it!

                         KITTY
          - if you do, I'll lend you my green
          slippers.
          Mr Bennet winks at Elizabeth and turns to Mary, a
          serious, somewhat pedantic young woman.

                         MR BENNET
          And what do you say, Mary? Are you not
          excited by the prospect of a ball?

                         MARY
          Society has claims on us all, Papa. As
          long as I have my mornings to myself, I
          consider an interval of recreation and
          • amusement as quite desirable.
          Elizabeth laughs.
