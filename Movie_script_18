## Script:
INT. BROOKLYN APARTMENT - NIGHT
AMY ELLIOTT, early 30s, gorgeous, is in a crowded hipster party. Dude-heavy. She weaves her way through the guys.
AMY (V.0.) I met a boy.


She spots her FRIEND deep-flirting a guy, and stops midway, stuck with TWO BEERS. She makes her way toward a table with picked—over food and scans the room for anyone she knows. She spots NICK DUNNE—he spots her.
AMY (V.0.)
A great, gorgeous, sweet, cool-ass
guy.
Nick weaves his way over. She’s setting down her beer.
NICK
It’s dangerous to set down a monk— * brewed Belgian wheat beer when the * party is down to three Beast Lites
and a bottle of Pucker.
AMY
Might attract some desperate
characters.
He gestures toward a group of Williamsburg musician-types: suspenders and broad-brimmed hats.
NICK
Things could get ugly. The Amish
are on Ruinspringa.
AMY
They already relieved me of my
artisanal meat platter.
NICK
Finally, someone to tell me how to
pronounce that word. AMY
Meat?
NICK One syllable.
He picks up the beer.

NICK (CONT’D) Whose beer am I drinking?
(moving closer to her, so they have same POV)
What’s your type?

They scan the crowd together. Cozy. Nick points to a horn- rimmed, haughty DOUCHEBAG. 
NICK (CONT’D)  I can’t picture you sitting still  while he bloviates about his post-  grad thesis on Proust. 
Nick points to a sideburned guy in a NOVELTY TEE. 
NICK (CONT’D)  Ironic hipster so self—aware he  makes everything a joke? 
AMY 
I prefer men who are funny, not  ‘~funny.” 
Nick points to a wavy-haired granola-yoga type. 
NICK
Please tell me it’s not Deeply
Sensitive Emo-Dude
—who says things like “I love strong women.”
NICK
Code for ‘~I hate strong women.”
A beat as they scan the room, then face each other. 
AMY 
And what type are you? 
NICK
Corn-fed, salt-of the earth Missouri guy.
AMY 
Missouri?! How cute.
NICK
Ah: native New Yorker!

AMY
World ends at the Hudson. I’m l~my.
NICK
So tell me, Amy. Who are you?
AMY
A. I am an award—winning
scrimshander. B. I am a moderately influential warlord. C. I write personality quizzes for magazines.
NICK (taking her hand)
A. Your fingers are far too delicate for real scrimshaw work. 
B. I am a charter subscriber to Middling Warlord Weekly—I’m sure I’d recognize you. 
So: C.

AMY
And you? Who are you?
NICK
I’m the guy to save you from all
this awesomeness.

INT. APARTMENT ELEVATOR - NIGHT

They head down: tipsy, not touching, but thinking about it.
AMY
So if you write for a men’s
magazine, does that make you an expert on being a man?
NICK
In theory, I know what men drink,
what men wear-
AMY 
How men bullshit.
NICK
Not with you.
Amy laughs: ha, ha.
NICK (CONT’D) I’m serious.
She stops, studies him.

through a sugar storm unkissed. 
The sugar floats all around them. A fairytale. They lean in.
NICK (CONT’D)
Hold on.
Nick brushes her lips clean. They kiss.
INT. NICK’S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
A SHABBY, CRAMPED garden studio apartment. BARS on the
windows. NICK and AMY are in bed: blissful. Outside, a car’s 
headlights flash: Their sugary prints light up the headboard. 

AMY
It’s hard to believe you. I think
it’s your chin. NICK
My chin?
AMY
It’s quite villainous.
She places a finger over his chin. Tests the view.
NICK
No bulishit. 100% truth
