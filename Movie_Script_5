## Script:
As Lionel gets to the door of a large Colonial style home he
     checks his pockets. He's missing something. Shit.

                         LIONEL
                   (knocking)
               Kurt! You home?

     Lionel dials on his cell and we hear the PHONE RING from
     inside. Voicemail pops on with a voice other than Lionel's.

                         ANSWERING MACHINE
               Hey boyssss, you've reached Lionel
               Higginsss, the only bitch on
               campussss who'll give you a
               dickssscount. That's right hunty,
               the bigger the dick the less you'll
               have to pay me to ssssuck it.

     The beep sounds. Lionel's in shock. Should he hang up? Or...

                         LIONEL
               Kurt. It's Lionel. I'm locked out.

     As Lionel slides down the length of the door into a sit he
     unfolds the flyer he was just handed. It's a rendering of Sam
     White on a carton of milk with the caption:

     "MISSING BLACK CULTURE - SAM WHITE TO BRING IT BLACK"
                                                              4.


6    EXT. MANCHESTER ROW - DAY                                     6

     Signs scream out "ORIENTATION" as jazz music wafts from the
     laptops of a group of NEO BEATNIKS. As the music fades...

                         SAM (O.S.)
               Dear White People, apparently
               Morgan Freeman in "Deep Impact"
               wasn't enough. Despite two terms
               Obama could cure Cancer and
               somewhere White folks will be
               embroiled in protest. And he's only
               half Black.

     GABE, 24, white and ruggedly handsome in spite of his shaggy
     hair and "laundry day" flip flop clad ensemble, catches the
     end of this as he passes - grabs his cell phone and dials...

7    INT. STUDIO BOOTH - DAY                                       7

     ...Sam presses a button next to a red light on her controls.

                         SAM
               Talk to me.

     INTERCUT with Gabe walking about on campus.

                         GABE
               What would you say if someone
               started a Dear Black People?

                         SAM
                   (recognizing the voice)
               No need. Mass media from Fox News
               to reality tv on VH1 makes it clear
               what white people think of us.
