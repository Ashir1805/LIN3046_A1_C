## Script:

 EXT. STREET. OUTSIDE THE GATE

          Annie sits in her old shitty car. She lets out an
          exasperated sigh, then sees the clock.

                         ANNIE
          Oh, shit.
          The brakes squeak as she very slowly drives away.

          INT. ANNIE'S CAR IN TRAFFIC. CONTINUOUS.

          Annie gets out her phone and speed dials LILLIAN.

          INT. LILLIAN'S BEDROOM.

          Lillian is getting dressed. Upscale, professional
          clothes.

                         LILLIAN
          It's summer?! What the hell does that
          mean? He can't date anyone in the summer?

                         ANNIE
          I guess? I don't know. I feel so stupid
          now.

                         LILLIAN
          No he's stupid Ann, not you.

                         ANNIE
          I think I might be a little bit stupid.

                         LILLIAN
          Ew. Did you have sex with him?

                         ANNIE
          No! But I gave him a blow job.

                         LILLIAN
          What?!

                         ANNIE
          Well, he kept putting it in my face.
          Lillian's boyfriend DOUGIE enters the bedroom eating a
          Luna Bar in his sweats. He's stretching and flexing his
          muscles trying to make her laugh.       

          5.

                         LILLIAN
          Well, at least he was honest with you so
          you don't waste your time with him.

                         DOUGIE
          Baby, look how hard I worked out. Look at
          all this sweat.

                         LILLIAN
          Can you see that I'm on the phone? I'm
          talking to Annie.

                         DOUGIE
          Hey Annie.

                         LILLIAN
          Are you eating my Luna Bar? Those are for
          women you know?

                         DOUGIE
          Shit. Really?!

                         LILLIAN
          It's not gonna do anything to you.

                         DOUGIE
          Oh my God. My breasts are getting bigger.
          He tries to rub up against Lillian.

                         LILLIAN
          Ew, go take a shower.
          Dougie leaves.

          DOUGIE (O.S.)
          I'm gonna play with my new boobs in
          there.

                         LILLIAN
          I swear I cannot handle him right now. He
          has been driving me crazy. Sometimes it
          feels like I'm kissing my brother. I
          don't know what do.
          Annie pulls into an alleyway behind HARRINGTO'S JEWELRY
          STORE and starts changing into her work uniform in the
          car. A white blouse and navy skirt.

                         ANNIE
          At least you have someone. God, wha's
          wrong with me?
