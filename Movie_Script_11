## Script:

  OLD ROSE : I saw my whole life as if I'd already lived it... an endless parade of parties and cotillions, yachts and polo matches... always the same narrow people, the same mindless chatter. I felt like I was standing at a great precipice, with no one to pull me back, no one who cared... or even noticed.

  JACK : Don't do it.

  ROSE : Stay back! Don't any closer!

  JACK : Take my hand. I'll pull you back in.

  ROSE : No! Stay where you are. I mean it. I'll let go.

  JACK : No you won't.

  ROSE : What do you mean no I won't? Don't presume to tell me what I will and will not do. You don't know me.
  
  JACK : You would have done it already. Now come on, take my hand.

  ROSE : You're distracting me. Go away.

  JACK : I can't. I'm involved now. If you let go I have to jump in after you.

  ROSE : Don't be absurd. You'll be killed.

  JACK : I'm a good swimmer.

  ROSE : The fall alone would kill you.

  JACK : It would hurt. I'm not saying it wouldn't. To be honest I'm a lot more concerned about the water being so cold.
