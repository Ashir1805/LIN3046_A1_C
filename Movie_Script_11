## Script:

  WOMAN
Hello, Dad. You sonofabitch.
Cooper peers into the face, recognizing -
COOPER
(whispers)
Murph?
WOMAN (MURPH)
I never made one of these when you
were still responding cos I was so
mad at you for leaving. When you
went quiet, it seemed like I should
just live with my decision. And I
have ...
(Looks around.)
But today’s my birthday. And it’s a
special one because you once told
me -
She stops, unable to speak for a second.
MURPH
You once told me that when you came
back we might be the same age ...
and today I’m the age you were when
you left ...
(Starts crying.)
So it’d be a real good time for you
to come back.
Murph reaches up, switches off the camera and we stay with
her in -
80.
INT. COMMUNICATION ROOM, NASA - DAY
Murph brings her hand down from the camera. Wipes her tears.
PROFESSOR BRAND
(O.S., softly)
I didn’t mean to intrude.
Murph turns to see Professor Brand, now ELDERLY, in a
WHEELCHAIR in the doorway.
PROFESSOR BRAND
I’ve never seen you in here before.
Murph rises -
MURPH
I’ve never been in here before.
Murph wheels Professor Brand out into the corridor.
INT. CURVING CORRIDOR, NASA - MOMENTS LATER
Murph pushes Professor Brand.
PROFESSOR BRAND
I talk to Amelia all the time. It
helps. I’m glad you’ve started -
MURPH
I haven’t. I just had something I
wanted to get out.
INT. PROFESSOR BRAND’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER
Professor Brand wheels behind his desk.
PROFESSOR BRAND
I know they’re still out there.
MURPH
I know.
PROFESSOR BRAND
There are so many reasons their
communications might not be getting
through.
MURPH
(smiles gently)
I know, Professor.
81.
PROFESSOR BRAND
I’m not sure which I’m more afraid
of ... they never come back, or
they come back to find we’ve
failed.
She watches his introspection. Brings him back with -
MURPH
Then let’s succeed.
PROFESSOR BRAND
(gestures at formula)
So, back from the fourth iteration,
let’s run it with a finite set.
Murph has picked up a notebook. Pauses.
MURPH
With respect, Professor. We’ve
tried that hundreds of times.
PROFESSOR BRAND
And it only has to work once,
Murph.
She shrugs. Starts to work.
INT. LAUNCH FACILITY - LATER
Murph and Professor Brand sit, eating sandwiches on a
walkway. WORKERS move about the CIRCULAR CHAMBER, building
more SIDEWAYS INFRASTRUCTURE. Professor Brand looks down,
proud.
PROFESSOR BRAND
Every rivet they drive in could
have been a bullet. We’ve done well
for the world, here. Whether or not
we crack the equation before I kick
-
MURPH
Don’t be morbid, Professor.
PROFESSOR BRAND
I’m not afraid of death, Murph. I’m
an old physicist - I’m afraid of
time.
82.
INT. PROFESSOR BRAND’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER
Murph stands before the algebra. She REALIZES something.
