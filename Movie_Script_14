       Barossy Nagyavaros. 

       ANN. How do you do? [he kisses her hand]  The Master of 

       Ceremonies announces the long German name and title of the next 

       guest. 

       ANN [holding the woman's hand as she curtsies] Guten aben. [She 

       greets the man as he kisses her hand].  The Master of Ceremonies 

       announces the next couple. As she greets them, Ann rubs her tired 

       right foot against her leg.  Much later on and Ann is still 

       greeting the guests. 

       ANN [greeting another couple] So happy.

       ANN. Good evening, Countess [holding her hand the woman curtsies. 

       To the Count]. Good evening. 

       COUNT [kissing her hand] Good evening. [Suddenly, Princess Ann 

       loses her balance as her foot slips over her shoe, knocking it 

       over. The Count's eyeglass pops out in surprise and he smiles 
       
       back as she regathers herself. The Ambassador looks down in 

       disappointment at her error. The Master of Ceremonies introduces 

       the next couple-a Senor and Senora]. 

       ANN [she tries to manipulate her shoe back into position which 

       has been knocked over and she greets the couple, disguising her 

       discomfort] Good evening [the man kisses her hand].  The Master 

       of Ceremonies announces the next guest as Ann pushes her shoe 

       again in an effort to right it. s it. 

       ANN [brushing her hair] I hate this nightgown. I hate all my 

       nightgowns. And I hate all my underwear too. 

       COUNTESS [coming over to tend to her bed, dressed in a bedrobe 

       and wearing glasses] My dear, you have lovely things. 

       ANN. But I'm not two hundred years old! [Dropping down on the 
       
       bed] Why can't I sleep in pyjamas? 

       COUNTESS [looking up as she folds the sheets into place] Pyjamas! 

       ANN. Just the top half. [The Countess takes off her glasses, 

       shocked, then walks over to the window. Ann pulls the covers over 

       her, sitting up] Did you know there are people who sleep with 

       absolutely nothing on at all? 

       COUNTESS [opening the window] I rejoice to say that I did not. 

       ANN [lying against the headboard, smiling as she hears distant 

       music coming in through the window] Listen. [She jumps up out of 

       bed and runs over to the window, looking out]. 


       COUNTESS. Oh, and your slippers. [She goes to fetch them from 

       beside the bed as Ann looks out with pleasure at the dancing 

       going on far below in the distance] Please put on your slippers 

       and come away at the window. [Ann walks back to the bed, 

       dejected, as the Countess shuts the window. The Countess holds a 

       tray] Your milk and crackers. 

       ANN [taking the tray; as the Countess helps her pull the covers 

       over her] Everything we do is so wholesome. 

       COUNTESS. They'll help you to sleep. 

       ANN [stubbornly] I'm too tired to sleep-can't sleep a wink. 

       COUNTESS [putting on her glasses, taking a diary from the 

       bedtable] Now my dear, if you don't mind: tomorrow's schedule-or 

       schedule [(skedule)], whichever you prefer-both are correct. 

       [Running through the items with a pen] Eight thirty, breakfast 

       here with the Embassy staff; nine o'clock, we leave for the 

       Polinory Automotive Works where you'll be presented with a small 

       car. 

       ANN [disinterested; absently playing with a napkin] Thank you. 

       COUNTESS. Which you will not accept. 

       ANN. No, thank you. 

       COUNTESS. Ten thirty-five, inspection of food and agricultural
