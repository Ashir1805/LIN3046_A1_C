EXT. FITCH SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL - DUSK
          
          A few cars scatter the parking lot. WE hear GRUNTS followed
          by the distinct sound of basketballs shredding net.
          
          
          INT. FITCH SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL/GYM - CONTINUOUS
          
          An empty gymnasium except for a shirtless MIKE O'DONNELL, 17.
          Mike stands feet BEYOND the 3 point line, grabs balls from a
          hopper and rapidly shoots, shoots, shoots.
          SWISH...SWISH...SWISH. This kid's automatic.
          
          Mike's hair, a pompadour mullet a la `21 Jump Street' and
          short shorts circa 1989.
          
          Mustached and curly haired COACH HARVEY, 40, enters.
          
                              COACH HARVEY
                    Hey, O'Donnell, save some for the
                    game.
          
          Mike sinks one last jumper, turns to the Coach.
          
                              MIKE
                    Just warming up, Coach.
          
          Coach Harvey hands Mike a towel.
          
                              COACH HARVEY
                    First game of the season and the
                    scouts are already lining up. You
                    have half the season I know you're
                    capable of, you can play anywhere
                    you want, Mike.
          
                              MIKE
                    That's the plan coach.
          
          The rest of the FITCH FALCONS basketball team jogs out from
          the locker room followed by a PHOTOGRAPHER.
          
                              COACH HARVEY
                    Round up, Jock Straps! Picture
                    time.
          
          The Team assembles in the middle of the court. A PLAYER
          kneeling in front holds a sign, `FITCH FALCONS, 1989'.
          
                               MIKE
                    Hold on.   Ed's not here yet.
          
          DOM, 17, handsome, tall, long rat tail, scoffs-
          
                                                                     2.
          
          
          
                                  DOM
                    Who cares?      He's the water boy.
          
                              MIKE
                    And you suck, Dom, but we're
                    letting you in the picture.
          
          A shoving match breaks out between Mike and Dom.
          
                                  COACH HARVEY
                    Hey!   Hey!     Knock it off.
          
          Coach Harvey pulls the Players apart just as the gym doors
          burst open. ED FREEDMAN, 17, sporting a jacket over a WIZARD
          costume, runs in, trips on his robe, gets up, peels his
          clothes off.
          
                              ED
                    Sorry I'm late. I was locked in a
                    life and death battle with the dark
                    wizard...
          
                              COACH HARVEY
                    ...Fall in, Freedman. Hurry up.
          
          Ed takes a spot next to Dom.
          
                              PHOTOGRPAHER
                    And 3, 2, 1-
          
          WE see Dom reach behind Ed, grab hold of his
          underwear...RRRRIIIPP...FLASH. And with the flash WE cut to:
          
          
          INT. FITCH SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL/GYM - NIGHT
          
          The Falcons run, pass and shoot on one end of the court.    On
          the opposite end, a TEAM in BLUE warms up.
          
          Lights dim. Cue MC Hammer's `Can't Touch This'. CHEERLEADERS
          at center court perform the Hammer DANCE ROUTINE. PAN around
          the gym, everybody's doing the Hammer dance.
          
          Ed awkwardly tries to imitate Mike.
          
          Coach shakes his head in disgust and when the routine ends-
          
                              COACH HARVEY
                    Alright, Ladies, bring it in!
          
          The Falcons swarm to the bench, take seats.     Ed hands waters
          to the Players, skips Dom, stops at Mike.
          
                                                                  3.
          
          
          
                              MIKE
                    Ed, I can't help you with the girls
                    if you keep showing up places
                    dressed like the Cookie Crisp guy.
                    Okay? Dude, don't look now but I
                    think Muffy Campanella is scopin'
                    you hard.
          
                                ED
                    For real?
          
          Ed jerks around to blatantly stare at her.
          
                              MIKE
                    Smile, pud.
          
          Ed flashes a goofy smile.   MUFFY mimes puking.
          
                                MIKE (CONT'D)
                    My bad.
          
                                GIRL'S VOICE (o.s.)
                    Mike?
          
          SCARLET, 17, an 80's beauty, stands at the end of the bench.
          
                              MIKE
                    Who's that stone cold fox? Oh,
                    it's my girlfriend.
                        (walks over)
                    I'm glad you're here, Scar. This
                    whole scout thing's got me wicked
                    nervous.
          
          Dom dribbles past, smiles at Scarlet.
          
                              DOM
                    I'm dedicating my first basket to
                    you, Scarlet.
          
                              MIKE
                    Way you shoot that might be mid-
                    season!
                        (to Scarlet)
                    Everything cool?
          
          She smiles nervously, lies...
          
                               SCARLET
                    Oh yeah. Everything's totally
                    copacetic.
          
                                                                         4.
          
          
          
                       MIKE                              SCARLET
          Totally?                           Totally.
          
          REFEREE blows the whistle.
          
                               COACH HARVEY
                     Let's go! Remember, Boys, winners
                     get the girls. Losers please
                     themselves!
          
                               MIKE
                         (to Scarlet)
                     Excellent. Gotta run.
          
          He kisses her cheek, starts off, turns back-
          
                               MIKE (CONT'D)
                     What's wrong?
          
          LONG SHOT: We hear nothing but see Mike's body deflate. He
          steps away from Scarlet towards center court.
          
          Muffy and her friends mock Ed and laugh hysterically
          
                               ED
                     Do you really think Muffy's in to
                     me?
          
          Mike, in a daze walks right past Ed. Takes his place for the
          jump ball. The Crowd stomps and cheers LOUDLY.
          
          The Ref is about to toss the ball. Mike looks up at the
          stands, sees a crushed Scarlet heading for the exit. Mike's
          torn. Play or go after her. He goes after her.
          
                               COACH HARVEY
                     Where you going!? O'Donnell!?
