## Script:
                    SIR THOMAS
              I received a formal request for marriage
             today for Anne.
                     (a beat)
              From the Carey family.

    SIR THOMAS indicates to
                         ANNE; the eldest. Dark-haired.
    Intelligent. The obvious leader among the children.

                        LADY ELIZABETH
           But that's wonderful.

                        SIR THOMAS
             I turned it down.

     LADY ELIZABETH turns...`What?'

                        SIR THOMAS
            And offered them Mary instead.

    SIR THOMAS indicates 
                         MARY, the middle child. Fair-haired.
    Pretty. Sweet-natured.

                          SIR THOMAS
           Fnne's too good for William Carey. She
           can do (better than a merchant's son.

                          LADY ELIZABETH
            You underestimate Mary.

                          SIR THOMAS
            Not true. I think she's..the kinder of
           the two. Quite possibly the fairer.

    The CHILDREN, meanwhile, have started a race..

                         SIR THOMAS
           But to get ahead in this world, you need
           more than fair looks and a kind heart.

     On the field, ANNE wins. She jumps up and down, holding her arms
    aloft, as MARY flops to the floor. Vanquished.

                                                                2.


    SIR THOMAS smiles, `See?' He walks towards ANNE..

                        SIR THOMAS
                  (applauding his favourite)
           Bravo! Anne!


    EXT. BELL TOWER - TEN YEARS LATER
2                                                                    2
    Bells ring high up in the bell-tower of a country church.


    INT. MARY'S BEDROOM - DAY
3                                                                    3
    MARY, ten years older, and grown into a heavenly bride is in her
    room, surrounded by MAIDS and SEAMSTRESSES making final
    adjustments to her dress. A knock at the door.

                        ANNE
           May we come in..?

    ANNE and GEORGE enter. GEORGE lets out a low whistle..

                        ANNE
           Look at you..! Younger than me. More
           beautiful than me. Married before me.
                  (a beat)
           I am eclipsed. I am just the `Other
           Boleyn Girl.'

                        MARY
           Hardly.

                        GEORGE
           No, is this it? This is the end of the
           unholy trinity?

    GEORGE extends her arms, wraps them around his two sister. An
    intimate moment.

                        MARY
           No, George. Never. I'll be married,
           that's all..
                  (a beat)
           Apart from that - it won't change a
           thing.

    The three of them hug together, tightly..
