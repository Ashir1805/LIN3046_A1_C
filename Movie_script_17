## Script:

NT. SALON CAR. ORIENT EXPRESS. DAY.
Poirot greets MARY DEBENHAM as she enters. Offers her a couch beside Bouc. 
Mary does not seem nervous or upset. More like she was looking forward to her turn with him.
    
                       POIROT
           Miss Debenham. For you we take the more
           comfortable seat.
                       MARY DEBENHAM
           While you made my roommate suffer cramped
           quarters. I see. You choose the best location to extract the truth from each suspect. 
           Put her off balance, put me at ease. Clever. How did she fare?

                       POIROT
           Alas. You and she speak for each other.
           She says you did not leave the cabin and you will now say the same of she. 
           If I trust you I must trust her.

                       MARY DEBENHAM
           But you don’t trust me yet, you can’t
           possibly. We met briefly on a boat. Friendly, but not friends. A pale mauve, by the way.

Poirot grins, enjoying her. Pardon?

                       MARY DEBENHAM
           Miss Ohlsson told me you asked the color
           of her dressing gown. I can’t imagine why, but in case you wanted, that’s mine. 
           She’s very worried, she fears terribly you suspect her as the last person to see Ratchett alive.
           You don’t, do you?

                       POIROT
           Let us be fixed for the moment on you.
           Would you please write down your full name and permanent address here.

                       MARY DEBENHAM
           I have no address at present. I’m
           staying with my sister until my next employment settles. Is that all right?

She writes as asked. Poirot looks at the paper.

                       POIROT
           Mary Hermione Debenham, temporarily of 61
           Bevenden, London. You at times go by your middle name? Hermoione?

                       MARY DEBENHAM
           A constant Mary, when I’m not paid as
           Miss Debenham. You must not have your theory fixed if you’re
           testing my handwriting.Rooting through the rubbish bin. Right 
           handed by the way.

                       POIROT
                       (a nod to her insights)
           I admit I cannot make sense of the facts.

                       MARY DEBENHAM
           You can’t disappoint on this one. To
           catch the killer of a murderer. Forget famous, you’d be outright notorious.

                       POIROT
           Again, let us remain fixed on you.

                       MARY DEBENHAM
           Of course, of course. I’ll be a boring
           witness to you, I’m afraid.
           Bouc chuckles at the private joke on “I’m afraid.”

                       POIROT
           Alors, where were you when we stopped at
           Vincovci?

                       MARY DEBENHAM
           In my bed. Where I remained all night.
           Except to hear about our crash.

                       POIROT
           Did you have any opinion of the dead man.

                       MARY DEBENHAM
           I -- well, I can’t say I thought about
           it. IfheiswhoyousayIamgladnot to have known him. 
I don’t quite see the point of your question.

Poirot notes she’s become defensive. He grins, needles like an older brother:

                       POIROT
           It does not please you this method?

                       MARY DEBENHAM 
           It seems a waste of time.

                       POIROT
           Our train is buried, we have time to
           waste! Forgive my eccentricities. Human nature is perverse in its complexity. 
           To plumb it takes the right tools. Some are scattered and the cold air sharpens
           their answers, others are forthcoming when they think me dumb... And of course others
           are precise and deflective -- so I must ask what you feel, what you thought --

                       MARY DEBENHAM (chastising)
           Like the low ceiling for the tall woman. Spare your tools, Sir, and ask direct.

                       POIROT
           The stern governess emerges.

                       MARY DEBENHAM
           I employ the rules and the ruler only
           with the ones that need it. Preferring neither to good behavior.

                       POIROT
           Eh bien, the direct method. You knew
           Doctor Arbuthnot before the boat to Stamboul?
           Mary did not expect this. This is no longer any fun at all.

                       MARY DEBENHAM
           No.
                       POIROT
           Such camaraderie. Instant attraction
           then? Love at first... (off her reaction)
           We are not in America, there are no laws against it, Mademoiselle.

                       MARY DEBENHAM
           Nor are there laws against my silence.
           And I’ve never been to America.

                       POIROT
           Do you think Doctor Arbuthnot could have
           committed the crime?
                       MARY DEBENHAM 
           Certainly not.
                       POIROT
           I must remind you that you do not know
           him very well, Mademoiselle.

                       MARY DEBENHAM
           I know the type well enough. I could be
           wrong -- it’s an instinct. As governess 
           it’s my job to see bad behavior in the seconds 
           before it happens -- I daresay I’ve stopped a thousand fights
           from breaking out, or pencils launched, or milk cups caught before
           tumbling. I have reflexes for misbehavior -- and they were not engaged.

                       POIROT
           Very good. I will now ask the meaning of
           certain words I heard on our ferry ride. You and the stranger 
           Arbuthnot standing closer than strangers might, you said, “Not 
           now. When it’s all over. When it’s done. Then nothing can touch us.”
           He enjoys her surprise.

                       POIROT
           At my school when I was young there were
           no unwritten rules about eavesdropping.

                       MARY DEBENHAM
           You think I meant murder. “To a man with
           a hammer every problem is a nail.” You live crime, you see it in your 
           work every day. You can’t imagine two people talking about anything else -- but evil.

                       POIROT
           Not so. I see enough crime to know the
           criminal act is the anomaly. One person committed this murder, 
           the rest here are decidedly average, containing the usual admixture of good and bad, 
           fine and irritating, fidelity, charity and guile -- but not evil -- 
           nothing so broken as the ability to drug a man and kill him as he lies defenseless
           -- wildly stabbing his body about the chest and neck 12 times -- then watch him watch 
           you as the life spills slowly out of him -- until the sin is complete.
           No, I do not see crime in every conversation, but when I do it is
           as ignorable to me as glass in the teeth. So what, Miss, did you mean!

Shaken, Mary considers her answer. A long pause. Then she recovers herself. Meets Poirot’s eyes defiantly:

                       MARY DEBENHAM
           As we established. There are no laws
           against my silence.

                       POIROT (then)
           It doesn’t matter. I shall find out.

A look held. A challenge. PRELAP: THE SLOW SCRAPE OF...
